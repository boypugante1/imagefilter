## Introduction

Image processing is a vital part of many modern applications, especially those that rely on camera systems and real-time data. The **ImageFilter** project showcases how to implement a custom filter using the MRTech IFF C SDK. With support for various formats like DNG, TIFF, and efficient processing on GPU using CUDA, this project aims to simplify and enhance image manipulation tasks.

## Features

- **Custom Filters**: Create and apply custom image filters tailored to specific needs.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Handle DNG, TIFF, and more.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize CUDA for faster processing.
- **Low Latency**: Designed for real-time applications.
- **REST API**: Easily integrate with other systems.
- **Compatibility with GenICam**: Streamline camera control and image acquisition.
- **Support for H264 and H265**: Efficient video encoding and decoding.

## Installation

To get started with **ImageFilter**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/boypugante1/imagefilter.git
   cd imagefilter
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the MRTech IFF C SDK installed. You can find installation instructions in the SDK documentation.

3. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   After building, you can run the application using:
   ```bash
   ./imagefilter
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the application running, you can apply filters to images. The basic command structure is as follows:

```bash
./imagefilter --input <input_image> --output <output_image> --filter <filter_type>
```

### Example

To apply a custom filter to an image, use:

```bash
./imagefilter --input image.jpg --output filtered_image.jpg --filter sepia
```

### REST API

The application also provides a REST API for integration with other systems. You can send a POST request to apply filters programmatically.

```json
POST /apply-filter
{
  "input": "image.jpg",
  "output": "filtered_image.jpg",
  "filter": "grayscale"
}
```
